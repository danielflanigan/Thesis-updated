\caption[Primary components of the millimeter-wave source.]{Primary components of the millimeter-wave source.
The terminator and amplifiers are built-in components, but are used only in broadband mode, in which they produce broadband noise.
In continuous-wave mode, we instead use an external microwave signal generator that feeds the input to the PIN switch.}

\section{Package for multichroic detectors}
\label{sec:hardware.package}

\todo[inline]{Describe the multichroic detector package.}
The upper piece, the \textit{holder}, includes the feedhorns and waveguides, structures used to align the wafer, and 
The lower piece, the \textit{lid}, closes the module and contains backshorts that improve the millimeter-wave coupling.

{
The interior of a cryostat used for detector testing, in its ``half-wave plate'' configuration.
Light from an electronic millimeter-wave source propagates down the rectangular waveguide and exits the feed horn.
The cryogenic half-wave plate may rotate the polarization axis.
The motor rotates the half-wave plate.
The Eccosorb slab is nearly opaque and provides a beam-filling black body load with a temperature that can be controlled using the heater.
This configuration is similar to that used for the optical testing of detectors described in Section~\ref{sec:multichroic.mkidarray02}.

The interior of a cryostat used for detector testing, in its ``optics box'' configuration.
Light from an electronic millimeter-wave source propagates down the rectangular waveguide and exits the feed horn.
The optics box contains mirrors (not visible) that convert the horn beam into a plane wave that illuminates the top of the detector package.
The Eccosorb slab is nearly opaque and provides a beam-filling black body load with a temperature that can be controlled using the heater.
The experiment described in Section~\ref{sec:sensitivity.measuring} used a similar configuration to that shown here.
The experiment described in Section~\ref{sec:loss.vortex} was performed with the package attached to the \SI{0.1}{K}, as shown here, but the optics box was removed and the magnet array was placed beneath the package, outside the cryostat shells that have been removed for this photograph.
